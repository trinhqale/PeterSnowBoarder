# PeterSnowBoarder
For Unity Practice. Inspired by my fav cartoon Family Guy. 

Story:
This time Peter is trying to ski with his armchair and not to crash his head on the ground (again). Player can use Left and Right Arrows to rotate Peter so he can avoid getting hurt. 

Progress:
The game is complete but there are a few bugs need to be fixed. Leaving them for now since I need to move on to another project.

Here's a demo:
